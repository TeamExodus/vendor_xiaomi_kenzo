But you talk, so I think you're weird

00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,256
Wait, Max Steel

203
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:41,593
What is this? / What do you know about
energy?

204
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,362
What is this?

205
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:47,763
Steel./Ya./Max what are you doing up
there

206
00:27:48,266 --> 00:27:50,702
Oh god, my mom comes, you have to hide

207
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:53,638
What is she dangerous?

208
00:27:53,638 --> 00:27:56,198
Oh no

209
00:27:56,875 --> 00:27:59,477

Are you okay? / Yes, I'm fine fine, I

212
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:09,587

213
00:28:09,587 --> 00:28:11,656
I called last night

214

You sleep when I got home, are you okay?
/ I'm fine

215
00:28:16,728 --> 00:28:18,719
Course

216
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:24,536
Uh, no, I just exercise

217
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:28,563
I want to take laundrymu./Tidak, I
could do laundryku alone now

218
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:34,274
Strange sometimes, and you'll be late

219
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:38,283
There was an explosion and

220
00:28:38,283 --> 00:28:40,752
I can, I can

221
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:44,389
What are you doing, watch me

222
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:47,559
Why did you do it? / There is energy in
you

224
00:28:55,767 --> 00:28:59,504
I'll leave

225
00:28:59,504 --> 00:29:02,207
Not Max, hear

226
00:29:02,207 --> 00:29:06,411
You will produce energy takion all your
life, and that's what I eat

227
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:08,747
Without it I actually starve to death

228
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,548
Once you

229
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,817
Once you know what? / Yes

230
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:14,512
We are together forever

231
00:29:16,287 --> 00:29:20,280
Well, I want to know all that you know
sekarang./Oke

232
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:22,927
Okay, how energy

233
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:25,830
Takion it, where they come from

234
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:28,533
Uh .. the past

235
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:31,336
You're doing this to me? / No, I guess
you do this to me

236
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,972
You wake aku./Kau going to kill me? /
Yes

237
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:37,242
Actually, you do not realize how lucky
you are to me there

238
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:39,577
Yesterday to melegakanmu of energy
berlebihanmu

239
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,478
Because you just will meledak./Baik, I
understand

240
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:48,350
So what, you're like a vampire space?

241
00:29:55,593 --> 00:30:36,894
{AD]

242
00:30:38,870 --> 00:30:42,907
Excuse Max, why do we hide

243
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,877
You're an alien? They membedahmu or
what?

244
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,013
Dissecting is open organisms die to be
learned

245
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,243
That makes no sense, because I do not
die

246
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:57,121
Great work Max, now

247
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,823
See This

248
00:30:58,823 --> 00:31:02,560
We are connected with Max

249
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:04,926
It's okay, I did not see it

250
00:31:11,836 --> 00:31:15,006
Spread, found

251
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:18,643
They chase us

252
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:22,280
Who wants to kill you? / Who wants to
kill us

253
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,949
Ayolah./Aku not know

254
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:28,019
I've told everything I ingat./Tunggu ,
wait

255
00:31:28,019 --> 00:31:30,749
Wait, I remember something else

256
00:31:45,036 --> 00:31:47,402
Do not do

257
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,911
What is it?

258
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:57,582
What the hell is it? / I do not know, I
saw him too

259
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:00,485
I like building

260
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:04,455
As I recall, but I see you

261
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:08,026
I see refleksimu, I was you

262
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:11,296
It's your memory, why do I see your
memory

263
00:32:11,296 --> 00:32:13,564
I told you, we're connected

264
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:17,835
You did not hear aku./Aku hear about ..

265
00:32:17,835 --> 00:32:20,605
Ultralink./Apa it you? / Ulterlink.

266
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,541
No, it's very dangerous , they

267
00:32:23,541 --> 00:32:26,678
They destroy the world, they destroy
everything

268
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:30,281
They come, we should go from here

269
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,684
They come kebumi./Karena ibuku./Tidak
you're afraid, because people with a
gun chasing us

270
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:38,489
Because you think we are attacked

271
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,720
We had to go to a certain place where
they will not attack us

272
00:32:44,429 --> 00:32:47,832
I can not believe I'm doing this

273
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,824
Hei./Hai

274
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:55,306
You can not do it, you want them
dissect ?

275
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,841
That I remember

276
00:32:56,841 --> 00:32:59,377
You have to calm, understand mengerti.
/Aku

277
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:03,681
I do not control suhuku

278
00:33:03,681 --> 00:33:08,453
Measure the area of point A to point B

279
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:11,990
Mutual this formula, because this will
be in the final

280
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:15,326
This being lied

281
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:18,420
Do not trust

282
00:33:20,965 --> 00:33:23,868
I let ipodku flame

283
00:33:23,868 --> 00:33:27,395
What did you do, do not lie

284
00:33:27,772 --> 00:33:30,575
Are you crazy? / We're in attack

285
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:32,510
We're under attack

286

Merusaknya./Bukan I feel that, right

296
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,709
No, I'm just a person who is too weird

297
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:07,912
Maybe I can make it up to you

298
00:34:07,912 --> 00:34:14,652
Yes, and how are you doing itu./Oke

299

We can talk about this later

301

I had to run, will be late for

Zumbaku class

303
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,371
Creature that girl makes heart rate and
breathing increases

304
00:34:33,371 --> 00:34:36,641
Perhaps you should avoid dealing with
dia./Mungkin you must be silent

305
00:34:36,641 --> 00:34:39,508
See, he's upset

Okay, we should go from here

Steel.

01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:26,028
It scrambles parts / How many.

573
01:04:26,028 --> 01:04:29,964
Dozens maybe if we're lucky / We no
time there was a storm

Ultra link what would you be like her?

575
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,573
You do not like iron.

576
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:40,409
First endanger the lives

577
01:04:40,409 --> 01:04:44,680
This menambil / I'm not ready for this
/ Yes.

01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:54,724
Can stop them together.

581
01:04:54,724 --> 01:04:57,927
There is a strong wind

582
01:04:57,927 --> 01:05:00,663
Steel resistant ultra link.

583
01:05:00,663 --> 01:05:02,893
I turn on the point.

584
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:06,402
90 miles per hour.

585
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:09,462
When all firing operation.

586
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:15,303
We fled with steel we should siapsiap
in twenty seconds.

That man cap / Includes the outside
world.

593
01:05:35,564 --> 01:05:38,701
When space kit stuck there's not much
time.

594
01:05:38,701 --> 01:05:41,003
I guess it was not too fast.

595
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:43,904
There's something wrong, auto defense
has at sabotage.

Turn on the power / And I'll kill you.

610
01:06:46,535 --> 01:06:48,904
I will drain you.

611
01:06:48,904 --> 01:06:52,274
From your energy there.

612
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,910

You made this very easy.

623

You know what I used to be, I'm not

So let me know monseter coming.
